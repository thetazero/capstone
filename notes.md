## More To Do
- Marsden Chorin a mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics.
  - maybe read
-  Read more continued fractions.
- Try to make k=1000 (depth) and see convergence
- Find errors
- Faster computations
- make Figure 1 like visualization for p, q maybe make them drag able?
- Naiver Stokes case
## Explanation

Compute roh n using 2.7

## Errors

## Fixed appointments

Tuesday 4pm+ EST
Thursday 9:30am-11:30am EST
Friday 10am EST
Wednesday 9:30am, 7pm EST

## Actually do things
- Monday September 28th 8:30am PST, 11:30am EST
- Make graphs of f, g (with error bounds)
- Solve the equation
