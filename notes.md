## More To Do
- Marsden Chorin a mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics.
  - maybe read
- Faster computations
  - not sure how
- make p, q dragable
- Naiver Stokes case (cases I+, I-)
- Allow entering of margin of error for solution, instead of debth input.
- Learn argument principle
- Case II
- Give the answer + case


- reverse colors media query maybe
@media (inverted-colors: inverted) {
  p {
    background: black;
    color: yellow;
  }
}
