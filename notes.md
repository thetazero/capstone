## More To Do
- Marsden Chorin a mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics.
  - maybe read
-  Read more continued fractions.
- Try to make k=1000 (depth) and see convergence
- Find errors
- Faster computations
- make Figure 1 like visualization for p, q maybe make them drag able?
- Naiver Stokes case
- Theorem 2.9 original paper, cases I+, I-
- Allow entering of margin of error for solution, instead of debth input.
- Go through notes page
- Learn argument principle
