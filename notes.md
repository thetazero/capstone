## More To Do
- Marsden Chorin a mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics.
  - maybe read
- Faster computations
  - not sure how
- make p, q dragable
- Naiver Stokes case (cases I+, I-)
- Allow entering of margin of error for solution, instead of debth input.
- Learn argument principle
- Case II
- Give the answer + case
- show case onload
- worked out example
- Varient, debth
- Explanation of graph for each page
- Don't need to track error


1. Send writing over to him by Wednesday, brief Euler+Navier Stokes description and stablitiy. Detailed description of methodology. Make it a tex file.
1. Add I+, I- for Navier-Stokes case 
1. Then start on II case

- reverse colors media query maybe
@media (inverted-colors: inverted) {
  p {
    background: black;
    color: yellow;
  }
}
